# CF_Python-Gun-Violence-Project
An exploratory analysis of gun violence incidents in the US between January 2013 and March 2018. 
## Objective
The objective was to analyze the violence and deaths caused by using weapons in the United States. Thanks to this analysis, it will be possible to respond to answers such as which group and states are most affected or if there is any correlation between the deaths and the male gender.
## Data
Throughout this Project, I used open-source data from Kaggle. The data was downloaded from gunviolencearchive.org. From the organization's description:

Gun Violence Archive (GVA) is a not-for-profit corporation formed in 2013 to provide free online public access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States. GVA will collect and check for accurate, comprehensive information about gun-related violence in the U.S. and then post and disseminate it online.

## Results
Some results show that the most affected cities are Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington. At the state level, Illinois and California ranked first, with more than 15,000 cases of violence.
